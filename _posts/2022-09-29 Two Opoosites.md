## Two Opposites
Two opposites is a game about the journey of two opposites (characters with mirrored controls) separated by a mirror. They need to solve puzzles to escape the mirror world and finally meet each other. However, the challenge lies in the fact that they can only solve these puzzles together. You can play it in your browser [here](https://makra.itch.io/two-opposites) <br><br>
The game was made in a week (in a team of three) for the Brackeys Game Jam (10k+ people participated worldwide) and ranked **#22 in the innovation category.** <br>

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}
