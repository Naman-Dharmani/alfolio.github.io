* Play [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makra.fert) 
* Made in 2-3 days (I was stepping my shoes into game development that time) to be displayed in some Senate Meeting by our current club secretary. 
* This game also includes a free open source database that I used to create an online leaderboard completely free (without paying google Playâ€™s 25$ cost)
* Solo developed in Unity as a starter 2D project.
