I’m a senior undergraduate at IIT Gandhinagar. I’m into developing games, VFX, editing videos, computer graphics, and simulations. You can find the projects that I've worked upon in my undergraduate years [here](https://alfolio.github.io/projects). If you want the source code/ build of any of these you can contact me!

Few of them are available  on my [Github](https://github.com/aniketrajnish). The design & development documents of the projects and games that I've mentioned below are can be found [here](https://alfolio.github.io/blog).
