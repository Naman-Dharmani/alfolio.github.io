I’m a senior undergraduate at IIT Gandhinagar. I’m into developing games, VFX, editing videos, computer graphics, and simulations. I’ve mentioned some of my work below. If you want the source code/ build of any of these you can contact me!

Few of them are available  on my [Github](https://github.com/aniketrajnish). The design & development documents of the projects and games that I've mentioned below are can be found [here](https://aniketrajnish.github.io/docs).
